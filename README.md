# Udacity-Pytorch_Challenge

Udacity and Facebook's PyTorch Challenge for scholarship to the Deep Learning nanodegree. Taking part in this initiative to see what I can do with deep learning on Pytorch.

This repository should house all the projects and labs in the course. I'll try to make this as updated as possible. I'll also add a `logs.md` similar to the one I did for the Deep Learning Nanodegree to have a journal of my progress.
